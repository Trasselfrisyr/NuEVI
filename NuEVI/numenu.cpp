Notes on the original menu implementation

# Menus

## Main Menu

### Transpose
Sub menu with values -12 to 12.

### Octave
Sub menu with values -3 to +3

### MIDI CH

Sub menu with values 0 to 16. Should be 1 to 16, but there might be a bug
either in my simulation code, my changes to the menu or a bug in the original
menu.

### Adjust

This is a special option where the Adjust menu mode is entered. It take over
the display and draw horizontal indicators for threshold and such. More on
this in a later section.

### SETUP BR

Breath setup. Opens a new menu with breath specific stuff.


### SETUP CTL

Controls setup. Opens a new menu.
